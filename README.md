HardDX is a hardware clone of the Yamaha YM2128 FM Operator type-S (OPS) and corresponding YM2129 EGS envelope generator using Python and Amaranth.  It aims for settings-compatibility for these chips, but not pin- and firmware-compatibility.

This project is not affiliated in any way with Yamaha or its brands.
